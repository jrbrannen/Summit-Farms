            <h3>All Alaskan dog breeds are considered a working class dog.  While some breeds were bred for carrying items or pulling sleds, others were bred for herding, guarding, and companionship.  All of the following breeds are very intelligent, extremely trainable, and highly energetic.  To reach their full potential, we recommend an experienced dog owner who enjoys spending time outdoors and doesn't require to leave their pet alone for long periods of time.  While some breeds have similar working qualities each breed has it's own distinct behaviors and mannerisms it excels at as well as looks and size.</h3>
